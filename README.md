# Project-Library
Library TheOdinProject

~~Last Commit: I acknowledge that there are still several errors in the code, such as the library insert function not containing all the displayed elements as in the main library. However, I have decided to postpone this project due to a low-energy workflow and my current exhaustion from working on it. I will continue learning new things and embarking on new projects, but for now, this one is on hold.~~

I've decided to see this project through to the end, as postponing projects can become a bad habit.
